	Standalone ECW 3.3 Drivers for GDAL
	===================================

This package contains standalone drivers for ECW raster files that      
can be built after GDAL has been built and installed as an "autoload"   
driver.                                                                 

The purpose of this code is allowing a separate building of the ECW
driver which is problematic for implied EULA. Note that in order to use
GDAL (and GDAL-based third parties product) along with Ermapper ECW SDK
you need to read, understand and approve the Ermapper EULA which can be
retrieved on the Ermapper site.

To build this driver it is necessary for it to find GDAL and ECW support
files. Typically the configure and build process would look something
like:

./configure --with-gdal=/usr/local/bin/gdal-config --with-ecw=/usr/local/ecw3.3
make
sudo make install

The ecw3.3 directory will contain the required includes and libraries as
compiled starting from the source Ermapper SDK.
